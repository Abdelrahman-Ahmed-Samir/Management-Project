# Management-Project

Introduction 
After some studies and questions for people we discovered that most find booking in the restaurant something tiring because it must go two days before to book and this is what makes people do not hesitate to restaurants like those that requested booking a while before and so we presented our program which will make it easier for people to book in the restaurant but also the process of ordering food so that the food is available to the customer and all of that only by pressing a button in the program the customer makes a choice The restaurant he wants, choosing the number of chairs for the people he's with, and choosing meals as well for each individual. 
 
Advantages: 

The program facilitates the customer's booking process in the restaurant and offers services such as booking the number of individuals and food for everyone.
